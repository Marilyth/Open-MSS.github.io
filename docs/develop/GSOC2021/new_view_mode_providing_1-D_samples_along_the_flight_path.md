## New view mode, providing 1-D samples along the flight path

-   **Project description**:
Many atmospheric measurement instruments measure atmospheric quantities in situ that is only at the location of the aircraft. Both for flight planning, but especially for flight analysis, it is beneficial to have available a kind of plot similar to those used by the scientists in data exploration, which is a simple 1-D plot of quantity over time with multiple quantities (e.g., water vapour and ozone volume mixing ratios). This feature may build upon the user interface of previous work package implementing multiple WMS layers.
