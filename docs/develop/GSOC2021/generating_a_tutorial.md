## Generating a tutorial for use of the MSS client
Schwerpunkt Infrastruktur

-   **Project description**:
The current documentation covers the basic installation of the tool, but not the practical usage, which has so far been taught in person. Here, a comprehensive tutorial with an exemplary flight planning shall be generated, preferably by automating the use of the client by scripts to generate a video with subtitles. In this way, the tutorial may be updated in case of interface or GUI design changes. In addition also the textual documentation shall be enhanced by simple use case scenarios.

-   **Skills**: Python, QT, UI programming, Git

-   **Difficulty level**: Medium
