This release of MSS brings a new collaboration interface.

Shivashis Padhi created the fundament for a collaboration server in the
MSS project in google summer of code 2019.
Tanish Grover continued this work in the google summer of code 2020 and
overworked our user interface. The initial idea of mscolab stems from
Reimar Bauer.
GSoC mentors were Reimar Bauer and Jörn Ungermann.
In addition to the mswms server the project now has a mscolab server
for editing a flight path.
